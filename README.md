## Purpose
Quack will stop the bot and teleport you to one of the 3 major cities and close the game if you wish after a specified time.

## Installation
* Put the files into ```.\RebornBuddy\Plugins\Quack```.
* When in-game go into the Plugins tab, enable the plugin and click on the "Quack!" button.
* Set the amount of hours and minutes you want the bot to run and then check "Enable".
* Quack should show you at what time the bot will stop and perform whatever action you specified.

You can close the Quack window once it has been enabled.

## Changes
* Fixed to work with multiple clients and the DX11 version of the game.
